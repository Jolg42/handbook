## Building the gitbook locally

You need node, gitbook-cli, and this repo

```
npm install -g gitbook-cli
git clone THIS_REPO
cd THIS_REPO
gitbook install
gitbook serve
```

**Note:** you might need to wait a moment for for the compiling to complete - you'll see a message about where the book is being served.

Run `gitbook help` to see different build options
